# urban-sniffle

a simple (sorta janky) console chat system written in Java. The name came from github's new repository name suggestion.

developed by me and [@Zeki-Zek](https://github.com/Zeki-Zek) in like a day so don't expect any masterclass code here.

has only been tested under a LAN network, but making it work in WAN with a public IP Address *might* work. We haven't tested it yet, but its pretty insecure anyways since we don't use any encryption.

# Running
- after cloning this repo with `git clone https://github.com/dar3v/urban-sniffle.git`:
